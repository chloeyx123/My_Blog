        <p class="text-muted"> Singapore is known for its multi-cultural lifestyle along with its excellent healthcare
          system and its cleanliness. It includes a unique blend of Malaysians, Chinese and even Indians. They were
          named as the top five sources of National Prideamong twenty-four components, identified by an IPS study that
          was released in 2021. Many of the locals in Singapore speak Singlish, as well as its better known, offical
          languages such as Malay, Chinese, English and Tamil. The name Singapore comes from the Malay words, Singa,
          meaning lion, and Pura, for city.</p>

        <p> Writer-director Greta Gerwig’s cinematic reinvention of Mattel’s most (in)famous toy comes on like a
          sugar-rush mashup of Pixar’s Toy Story 2, Carlo Collodi’s Pinocchio, the cult live-action feature Josie and
          the Pussycats and the Roger Ebert-scripted exploitation romp Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. It’s a riotously
          entertaining candy-coloured feminist fable that manages simultaneously to celebrate, satirise and deconstruct
          its happy-plastic subject. Audiences will be delighted. Mattel should be ecstatic.

          After a heavily trailered 2001-parody opening, we move to a pastel pink haven in which, “thanks to Barbie, all
          problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved”. This is Barbieland – a fantasy world in which
          big-haired dolls can be anything (lawyers, doctors, physicists, presidents), thereby inspiring equivalent
          feminine achievement out there in the “real world”. (“We fixed everything so all women in the real world are
          happy and powerful!”) </p>

        <p>Last summer, Tom Cruise was given credit for saving the theatrical experience with the widely beloved “Top
          Gun: Maverick.” One of our last true movie stars returns over a year later as the blockbuster experience seems
          to be fading with high-budget Hollywood endeavors like "The Flash" and "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"
          falling short of expectations. Can he be Hollywood's savior again? I hope so because “Mission: Impossible –
          Dead Reckoning Part One” is a ridiculously good time. Once again, director Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise, and
          their team have crafted a deceptively simple thriller, a film that bounces good, bad, and in-between
          characters off each other for 163 minutes (an admittedly audacious runtime for a film with “Part One” in the
          title that somehow doesn’t feel long). Some of the overcooked dialogue about the importance of this particular
          mission gets repetitive, but then McQuarrie and his team will reveal some stunningly conceived action sequence
          that makes all the spy-speak tolerable. Hollywood is currently questioning the very state of their industry.
          Leave it to Ethan Hunt to accept the mission.</p>
